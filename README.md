== README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

## Bloccit: a Reddit replica to teach the fundamentals of web development and Rails.

Made with my mentor at [Bloc](http://bloc.io).

The project is on Heroku: it's called [pipergragg-bloccit](http://pipergragg-bloccit.herokuapp.com). 

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...


Please feel free to use a different markup language if you do not plan to run
<tt>rake doc:app</tt>.


Most of the code you're looking for is in here: http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveModel/Errors.html

If you're up for a challenge, think about how you can use the methods in there to print out the errors for each field right next to the field rather than at the top of the page, even better, also style the field with a red label.

As for the pluralize, that's likely to be useful for more than just topics, so I'd put it in application_helper.

There is some interesting sample code in the comments here: http://apidock.com/rails/ActionView/Helpers/TextHelper/pluralize
